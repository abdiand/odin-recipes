   <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2> 
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Trim It</strong></li>
    <p>Tidy up the brisket by trimming the fat cap to leave about ¼" fat layer and removing the silver skin from the underside.</p>
    <li><strong>Season It</strong></li>
    <p>Generously with a 50:50 ratio of kosher salt and ground black pepper. (or freshly ground pepper.)</p>
    <p>Let it sit out at room temperature for about an hour.</p>
    <li><strong>Prep Your Smoker</strong></li>
    <p>This is one of the most important key parts in making sure your brisket comes out great, Brandon recommends setting up the temperature between 250°F to 275°F with post oak.</p>
    <p>(or your preferred type of wood)</p>
    <li><strong>Smoke It</strong></li>
    <p>Place the brisket in the smoker and cook it with the lid closed.</p>
    <li><strong>Wrap It</strong></li><p>With butcher paper when the bark is formed and the internal temperature reaches about 165° F. Then place back in the smoker until the internal temperature of the flat (thinner side) reaches between 200°F and 205° F, and it feels very tender and flexible to the touch.</p>
    <li><strong>Rest It</strong></li>
    <p>Still wrapped for at least <em>one to two hours</em> before slicing.</p>
    <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
